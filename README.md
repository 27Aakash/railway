AIM:

   -->To detect voltage drop in the Fire Detection Panel and send SMS to the respective authority

   
Procedure:
   1) create logic for sending SMS when the input voltage(110v) less than the threshold(90v).
   2) create logic for sending SMS when the voltage across the FDS cross below the threshold(22v).
   3) create logic for sending SMS when the relay turned ON.
